Steven Viscione
Assignment 1 
Web Programming

	My name is Steven Viscione and I am a fourth year student at Suny New paltz. 
    I have taken many computer science courses here and that is all the experience 
    I have so far in the field. What I have learned is revolved around object 
    oriented programming and mainly focused on java. The classes have consisted 
    of CS one, two, and three, OOP, and lastly assembly language. In assembly we
    learned about the lower level of programming and it gave me a better 
    understanding of how a CPU actually executes instructions at the bit level.
	This course is one that I am both excited and nervous about because it 
    involves new material other than java. I can safely say that what I learn 
    here will greatly increase my knowledge in the computer science industry 
    because it will be entail a lot of hard work on my own outside of the 
    classroom. I also am interested in the idea of being able to understand 
    the process of creating a fully functional website from the ground up.
